This is a small template-project to figure out how to configure Conan + CMake properly to be able to add third-party libraries fast and easy.

## In this particular project a few libraries was added as an example:
- Google Test (popular unit-test framework)
- LibCoro (C++20 coroutine library)

## The project is easy to build under Linux in one step:
simply run xbuild.sh script from command line using command `sh ./xbuild.sh`
